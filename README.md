# Veggie-Garden
Android App designed to help users track their planting progress.
The app will have a calendar, provide reminders for watering and information about certain plants' expected harvest times. 
All added plants will have a 'PlantID' that stores their information. 
Users shouldn't have to enter EVERYTHING, so weather, location, certain plant information and soil grade should be automatic. 
The main purpose is to make people's lives easier in regards to gardening/farming.

Collaborators: Tyler Groat (team lead), Tyler Webb, Nicholas Arsenault, Blaine Oania, and John Pagulayan
