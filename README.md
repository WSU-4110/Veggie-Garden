# Veggie-Garden
Android App designed to help users track their planting progress.
The app will have a calendar, provide reminders for watering and information about certain plants' expected harvest times. 
All added plants will have a 'PlantID' that stores their information. 
Users shouldn't have to enter EVERYTHING, so weather, location, certain plant information and soil grade should be automatic.
